      "description": "Querying (also called filtering or Boolean indexing) selects a 
      subset of a DataFrameâ€™s rows. We need a sequence of Boolean values, condition,
      with length equal to the number of rows of the DataFrame. The expres-
      sion df[condition] results in a DataFrame containing only those rows
      
      whose corresponding element in condition is True.
      Boolean sequences are easily constructed by comparing an array, index,
      or Series to a value using the comparison operators: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=."
