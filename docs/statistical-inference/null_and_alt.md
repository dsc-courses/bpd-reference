## Concept

:::info Terminology
**Null Hypothesis**: A precise assumption about how the data was generated.
- Example: The coin is fair (the probability of tossing a head is equal to 0.5).

**Alternative Hypothesis**: A different view about how the data was generated.
- Example: 
    1. The coin is not fair (the probability of tossing a head is not equal to 0.5).
    2. The coin is biased towards heads (the probability of tossing a head is greater then 0.5).
    3. The coin is biased towards tails (the probability of tossing a head is less then 0.5).
:::

:::note 
The **null hypothesis** must be written with **equal** sign. A statement with uncertainty, such as 'approximately equal', will not be considered as a null hypothesis.

- Example: "The coin is fair" can be interpreted as the probability of getting a head is 0.5. If the statement is "the coin is **_almost_** fair" or "the probability of tossing a head is **_approximately_** equal to 0.5", it is **no longer** a null hypothesis.

Since the **alternative hypothesis** is different from the null, it can be less than, greater than, or not equal to, but cannot be $\geq$ or $\leq$.
