## Concept

:::info Terminology
**Population**: The complete group of people, objects, or events that we want to learn something about.

**Sample**: A subset of a **population**. 

**Simple Random Sample (SRS)**: A sample drawn uniformly at random without replacement.

- "Uniformly" means every individual has the same chance of being selected.
- "Without replacement" means we won't pick the same individual more than once.

**Convenience Sample**: A sample made up of people who are easy to reach.
:::

**Sampling Strategy**

- Good idea ✅: Select individuals at random.

- Bad idea ❌: Using **convenience samples**, which often contain hidden sources of **bias**.
