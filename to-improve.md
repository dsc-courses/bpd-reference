# General improvement suggestions 
1. Nothing in mind for edit functionality, Maybe scrap it and instead put google form out for student suggestions (use menti email) 
2. adding in a short Jupyter notebook environment on each page with the examples so students could experiment https://github.com/cs124-illinois/playground 
3. New UI for DSC 10 Webpage so resources are more clearly highlighted 

# BPD reference issues to fix
1. Add all diagrams and visualizations to the reference, also link them back to resources: 
https://dsc10.com/diagrams/#binning-and-histograms 
- Grouping
- Binning and histograms
- Defininig functions
- Merging 
- Boostrapping 
- Permutation test- shuffling (We do have links to the summary visualization, but I really think we shall give students all the diagrams we have here. 
2. df.assign() add example for series 
3. Add commonly-used string methods to reference: join, count, lower/upper, strip(), replace, split, title, np.repeat. 
4. Add more example for merging
