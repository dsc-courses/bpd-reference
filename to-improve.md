2. adding in a short Jupyter notebook environment on each page with the examples so students could experiment https://github.com/cs124-illinois/playground 
3. New UI for DSC 10 Webpage so resources are more clearly highlighted? 
4. Add more examples for groupby 
    - Note: when grouping by count, all columns will give the same value EXCEPT IF THERE ARE NANS. 
    - For grouping by multiple columns with different aggregation methods.
5. Rearrange the pages so their orders make more sense according to the natural progression of the course.
